The Odin Project

Project: Ruby Building Blocks
----------------------
Various Ruby Programming projects from TOP.

Project 1: Caesar Cipher
------------------------
Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factors and then outputs the modified string.

Project 2: Stock Picker
-----------------------
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Dats start at 0.

Project 3: Substrings
-----------------------
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
